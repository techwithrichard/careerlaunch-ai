# Phase 05 – Operations, Scale & Compliance

Harden the platform for production scale, reliability, and regulatory compliance.

## 1. Reliability Engineering
- [ ] Define SLOs/SLIs for critical user journeys, with alerting via Prometheus/Grafana.
- [ ] Implement auto-scaling policies and regional failover for core services.
- [ ] Add chaos testing to validate resilience under failure conditions.
- [ ] Establish runbooks and on-call rotation with incident management tooling.

## 2. Security & Privacy
- [ ] Complete threat modeling and penetration testing cycles.
- [ ] Enforce data retention, masking, and encryption at rest/in transit across all stores.
- [ ] Implement audit logging with tamper detection for sensitive actions.
- [ ] Prepare compliance evidence (FERPA/GDPR-style) for school partners.

## 3. Deployment Automation
- [ ] Build progressive delivery workflow (staging smoke tests, canary releases, blue/green).
- [ ] Integrate infrastructure drift detection and automatic remediation.
- [ ] Automate rollback playbooks triggered by SLO breaches or failed health checks.
- [ ] Publish release notes and change logs automatically from Git history.

## 4. Customer Success & Support
- [ ] Embed feedback loops, in-app surveys, and support ticket integration.
- [ ] Provide knowledge base and training materials for schools and mentors.
- [ ] Monitor adoption metrics with cohort analysis to drive continuous improvement.

## 5. Governance & Analytics Ops
- [ ] Formalize data governance council with access reviews and stewardship.
- [ ] Track model lineage, feature stores, and approval workflows for ML changes.
- [ ] Schedule regular business reviews tying product outcomes to school success metrics.

## Exit Criteria
- Platform meets reliability, security, and compliance expectations for large school networks.
- Delivery pipeline supports rapid, safe releases with clear rollback levers.
- Operational insights inform roadmap prioritization and customer success initiatives.
