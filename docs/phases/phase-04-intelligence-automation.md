# Phase 04 – Intelligence & Automation

Leverage data to deliver insights, predictions, and automated guidance.

## 1. Data Pipeline Foundation
- [ ] Implement ETL flows from transactional databases to the analytical warehouse.
- [ ] Anonymize sensitive learner data before analytics processing.
- [ ] Define dbt models for standardized metrics (application rate, interview conversion, offer velocity).
- [ ] Schedule incremental loads and quality checks (freshness, completeness).
- [ ] Reference: [`phase-04/01-data-pipeline-foundation.md`](phase-04/01-data-pipeline-foundation.md)

## 2. Recommendation Engines
- [ ] Train success prediction models for job fit using historical outcomes.
- [ ] Deliver skill gap analysis and personalized upskilling paths.
- [ ] Build mentor matching algorithm balancing expertise, capacity, and school priorities.
- [ ] Integrate model monitoring for drift and performance degradation.
- [ ] Reference: [`phase-04/02-recommendation-engines.md`](phase-04/02-recommendation-engines.md)

## 3. Automation & Nudges
- [ ] Launch workflow automation (e.g., follow-up reminders, interview prep) via rules engine.
- [ ] Create email/SMS templates and send pipelines with localization support.
- [ ] Support trigger-based tasks for mentors and learners derived from analytics signals.
- [ ] Ensure opt-in/out preferences and messaging compliance are enforced.

## 4. Transparency & Reporting
- [ ] Build dashboards highlighting learner progress, employer engagement, and placement metrics.
- [ ] Provide downloadable reports for school leadership with customizable filters.
- [ ] Surface AI explanation widgets so users understand recommendation rationale.
